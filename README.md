### 4Ô∏è Verifying VPN Connection
- Checked my public IP **before connecting to VPN**.  
- Connected VPN and checked my IP again .  
- Confirmed that the IP address changed successfully.

### 5Ô∏è Testing Encrypted Traffic
- Accessed websites like Google, YouTube, and BBC.  
- Traffic successfully tunneled through VPN.  
- Confirmed no DNS leaks using **dnsleaktest.com**.

### 6Ô∏è Disconnecting VPN & Comparison
- Disconnected VPN and rechecked IP.  
- Compared browsing speed with and without VPN.  
- Observed a slight **speed reduction (~15-20%)** due to encryption overhead.

##  Research & Concepts

###  What is a VPN?
A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** creates a secure tunnel between a device and the internet. It hides the real IP address and encrypts all traffic.

###  How Does a VPN Protect Privacy?
- Encrypts data (AES-256, ChaCha20)  
- Hides user‚Äôs real IP address  
- Prevents ISP, government, and hackers from monitoring browsing activity  

###  VPN vs Proxy
| Feature | VPN | Proxy |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Encryption |  Yes |  No |
| System-wide protection |  Yes |  No (browser/app specific) |
| Speed | Moderate | Faster but less secure |
| Anonymity | High | Low |

###  VPN Protocols
- **OpenVPN** ‚Äì Secure and widely adopted  
- **WireGuard** ‚Äì Lightweight, faster performance  
- **IKEv2/IPSec** ‚Äì Good for mobile stability  
- **L2TP/IPSec** ‚Äì Older, less efficient

##  Benefits of VPN
- Hides browsing activity from ISP & trackers  
- Secures communication over public Wi-Fi  
- Protects against Man-in-the-Middle attacks  
- Bypasses geo-restrictions (Netflix, YouTube, etc.)  
- Provides an additional layer of **cyber hygiene**  

##  Limitations of VPN
- Cannot ensure **100% anonymity**  
- Free VPNs may log user data  
- Slows down connection speed due to encryption  
- Some websites block known VPN IPs  
- Reliance on VPN provider‚Äôs trustworthiness
